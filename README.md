# factorize-prime-numbers
Program to find the two factors of the inputted integer (if there are such factors) by using mutiple threads and the time taken for this. Part of a course in parallel and distributed programming. 

# Usage
Compile and then run the program in a command line window.
The program takes two integers as input:
- the first integer should be the product of two prime numbers
- the second integer should be the number of concurrent threads the program should use for
the computation.
